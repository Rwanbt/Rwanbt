## About Me

Creative technologist evolving into systems programming.

My background in design, prototyping and audio engineering shapes the way I approach code:  
structured, iterative, and experience-driven.


Background in:
- 🎨 Design & Automotive Prototyping  
- 🎧 Audio Engineering & Production  
- 🛠 End-to-end project building  

Currently focused on low-level programming and computer science fundamentals at **Holberton School**.

I approach code the same way I approach design and music:  
structure, precision, iteration, and systems thinking.
